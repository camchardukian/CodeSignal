# Concatenate Arrays

[**Challenge Link**](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/code-arcade/list-forest-edge/GeqSK26bvdrarkGH9)

**Prompt:** Given two arrays of integers a and b, obtain the array formed by the elements of a followed by the elements of b.

**Initial Thoughts:**

```
// This seems easy. I'm pretty sure there's a native method to just concatenate one array to another.
```

**My Solution:**

```
function solution(a, b) {
  return a.concat(b);
}
```

**Reflection:** Yep, I got the ideal solution for this one.
